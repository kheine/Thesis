In order to probe the standard model or search for hints of new physics beyond the SM, experiments in particle physics often make use of powerful particle accelerators. In these machines, particles are collided to examine the constituents of matter and interactions between them. The analyses presented in this thesis are performed in the context of the CMS experiment located at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN near Geneva, which is the most powerful accelerator to date. \\ 
The first section of this chapter provides an introduction to the LHC, which is followed by an overview of the detector system of the CMS experiment. Afterwards, the different periods of collision data taking at the LHC are discussed. This chapter concludes with an introduction to the generation of simulated events which are needed for the analysis of real data events.  
\section{The Large Hadron Collider}
\label{sec:lhc}
The Large Hadron Collider~\cite{Bruning:782076, 1748-0221-3-08-S08001} is a ring accelerator designed to provide particle collisions of hadrons. It is built in the tunnel of the former LEP~\cite{LEPdesign} collider 45--170\,m below the surface and has a circumference of 26.7\,km. The LHC is a particle-particle collider and composed of two rings with counter-rotating beams. It can be operated in different modes with either proton or heavy ion (\eg lead) beams.~\footnote{All studies presented in this thesis are based on proton-proton collisions. Thus, the operation with heavy ions is not discussed.} \\
In each beam, protons are grouped together in bunches and accelerated in two evacuated beam pipes using superconducting radio-frequency cavities. With a nominal bunch spacing of 25\,ns, the collision frequency is 40\,MHz. Each of the 2808 individual bunches per beam contains $1.15 \times 10^{11}$ protons, at design conditions. In order to bend the beams around the LHC ring, superconducting dipole magnets are used at a temperature of 1.9\,K. They provide a magnetic field of up to 8.33\,T while additional quadrupole and sextupole magnets are utilized to squeeze and focus the beams.\\  
Before the protons are injected into the LHC, they are already pre-accelerated in various smaller accelerators, which are namely: Linac2, the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB), the Proton Synchrotron (PS) and the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS). With this injector chain, a beam energy of 450\gev is achieved. An overview of the accelerator complex at CERN is given in Fig.~\ref{fig:AccComplex}.

  \label{fig:AccComplex}
\end{figure}
\\
The main goal of the LHC is to provide proton-proton (\pp) collisions to the experiments with centre of mass energies up to 14\tev in order to explore physics processes at novel energy regimes. The expected number of events $N$ for a certain process is given by the product of the cross section $\sigma$ of that process and the integral $L = \int \mathcal{L}  \, dt$ of the instantaneous luminosity $\cal L$ over time such that
\begin{equation}
  N = \sigma \cdot L . 
  \label{eq:lumi}
\end{equation}
The luminosity is a machine parameter and can be expressed for beams with Gaussian-shaped profiles as  
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L} = \frac{f n_{1} n_{2}}{4 \pi \sigma_{x} \sigma_{y}} \cdot F
  \label{eq:lumi}
\end{equation}
with the collision frequency $f$, the number of particles $n_1$ and $n_2$ contained in the two colliding bunches and the transverse beam sizes $\sigma_{x}$ ($\sigma_{y}$) in the horizontal (vertical) direction. In order to take the inclination of the two beams into account, the geometrical correction factor $F$ is introduced. With design conditions, the nominal peak luminosity of the LHC is $10^{34} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-2} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Since the total inelastic proton-proton cross-section at a centre of mass energy of 14\tev is around 100\,mb, as indicated in Fig.~\ref{fig:CrossSections}, the expected event rate is approximately $10^9$ events per second. \\

  \label{fig:CrossSections}
\end{figure}
\\
The four main experiments are located at four of eight locations along the LHC ring where the beams cross and can be brought to collision. The two high luminosity experiments ATLAS~\cite{det::ATLAS} and CMS~\cite{Chatrchyan:2008zzk, bib:cmsptdr1} are designed for multiple purposes like precision measurements of SM quantities, search for the standard model Higgs Boson and searches for signals indicating new physics. The LHCb detector~\cite{det::LHCb}, however, is a specialised experiment and focuses on the measurement of CP violation in the interactions of hadrons containing b quarks. The only experiment especially designed for the analysis of heavy ion collisions is the ALICE~\cite{det::ALICE} detector with the main emphasis on the physics of strongly interacting matter at extreme energy densities, like quark-gluon plasma.

\section{The CMS Experiment}
\label{sec:cms}
The CMS detector is one of the two general-purpose experiments at the LHC designed to address several physics questions. In addition to tests of the SM at the TeV scale, studies of the nature of elektroweak symmetry breaking which might show up in the presence of a Higgs boson and searches for so far unknown particles pointing to, \eg new symmetries in nature, are the primary targets of these experiments. These ambitious goals can only be achieved by fully exploiting the provided collision energy and luminosity with a suitable detector concept.\\
The CMS detector with its typical cylindrical design of different sub-detector components around the beam line is designed to meet these requirements. A sketch of the CMS detector and the different sub-detectors is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CMS}.
\begin{figure}[!tp]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{c}
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/Figures_Experimental_Apparatus_CMS_perspective.png}
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{A perspective view of the CMS detector~\cite{Chatrchyan:2008zzk}.}
  \label{fig:CMS}
\end{figure}
As a typical high-energy particle experiment, the CMS detector makes mainly use of tracking detectors and calorimeters to measure momenta of particles, energy depositions and flight directions in order to identify the objects emerging from the particle collisions. The CMS detector with a length of 21.6\,m and a diameter of 14.6\,m exhibits a total weight of 12\,500\,t. \\  
The following sections comprise a description of the CMS detector and individual sub-detectors. A detailed discussion of the detector design can be found in~\cite{Chatrchyan:2008zzk, bib:cmsptdr1}. After the introduction of the CMS coordinate conventions in Sec.~\ref{subsec:cms_coordinates}, the superconducting magnet is discussed (Sec.~\ref{subsec:cms_magnet}). Afterwards, the tracking system (Sec.~\ref{subsec:cms_tracker}), the calorimeters (Sec.~\ref{subsec:cms_ecal} and~\ref{subsec:cms_hcal}) and the muon system (Sec.~\ref{subsec:cms_muon}) are described moving from the inside of the detector outwards. The detector description ends with a short review of the trigger system in Sec.~\ref{subsec:cms_trigger}.  

\subsection{Coordinate Conventions and Kinematic Variables}
\label{subsec:cms_coordinates}
In order to describe the particle collisions, the CMS experiment makes use of a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the centre of the detector at the nominal interaction point. While the $z$-axis is defined along the direction of the anti-clockwise beam, the $x$-axis points to the center of the LHC ring and the $y$-axis vertically upwards. In this $xy$-plane the azimuthal angle $\phi$ is measured where $\phi = 0$ coincides with the x-axis. The polar angle $\theta$ is defined with respect to the positive $z$-axis. A quantity closely related to the polar angle is the pseudorapidity $\eta$ defined as
\begin{equation}
\eta = \mathrm{-ln} \left[\mathrm{tan} \left(\frac{\theta}{2} \right)\right]
\end{equation}
which is widely used in experimental particle physics. A pseudorapidity $\eta = 0$ corresponds to the direction perpendicular to the beam while $|\eta| \rightarrow \infty$ points along the beams. Based on the pseudorapidity, the distance between two objects $\Delta R$, which is invariant under Lorentz boosts in $z$-direction, can be written as
\begin{equation}
\Delta R = \sqrt{(\Delta \eta)^2 + (\Delta \phi)^2} \, .
\end{equation}
At the LHC, the initial conditions of the primary collisions are not known, as the specific energy fraction of the proton which each parton carries can not be identified. Thus, conservation of the total momentum can not be utilized directly to describe the momentum balance in the final state. However, it is known that the initial particles have no significant momentum orthogonal to the beam axis which is referred to as \textit{transverse momentum}. Consequently, the transverse momentum is defined as 
\begin{equation}
\pt = \sqrt{p_x^2 + p_y^2} 
\end{equation}
and momentum conservation in the transverse plane is then used to describe the final state conditions. Hence, the vector momentum imbalance in the transverse plane (\metvec) is determined as the negative vector sum of the momenta of all particles. The absolute value of the vector momentum imbalance \met is typically termed \textit{missing transverse momentum} or \textit{missing transverse energy} and often exploited to describe undetected particles.

\subsection{Superconducting Magnet}
\label{subsec:cms_magnet}
The CMS experiment makes use of a large superconducting solenoid magnet which is a crucial component of the whole detector design. This magnet provides a uniform magnetic field in $z$ direction of up to 4\,T and allows to precisely determine the momenta and charge of charged particles from the curvature in the $(x, y)$-plane of the bended tracks, since it surrounds the tracking and calorimeter systems.\\
With a length of 12.5\,m and a diameter of the free bore of 6.3\,m, the total cold mass reaches 220\,t. The magnet is made up of a niobium-titanium coil which is winded in four layers. This configuration allows a storage of 2.6\,GJ energy at full current. \\
In addition, the muon system located outside of the solenoid is interleaved with a 10\,000\,t heavy-weight iron yoke which is responsible for the return of the magnetic flux and closes the magnetic field lines. This offers the opportunity to also measure muon momenta precisely.  

\subsection{Inner Tracking System}
\label{subsec:cms_tracker}
The tracking system of the CMS experiment is the innermost part of the detector and installed directly around the interaction point completely contained in the bore of the magnet system. Its purpose is to precisely measure the trajectories of charged particles arising from the collisions. Furthermore, it is used to identify secondary vertices. Due to the location close to the interaction point, the tracking system has to cope with a high particle flux. Hence, high requirements on response time and granularity are set to properly identify particle tracks. \\
In order to fulfill these tasks, the CMS experiment makes use of a tracker design based on silicon detectors. The innermost part is made of silicon pixel detectors. These are surrounded by silicon strip modules. In total, they add up to an active area of 200\,$\mathrm{m}^2$ with a length of 5.8\,m and a diameter of 2.5\,m, covering the detector region up to $|\eta| = 2.5$. A schematic overview of the whole tracking system is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CMS_tracker}. 
\begin{figure}[!tp]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{c}
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/Figures_Experimental_Apparatus_Tracker.png}
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Sketch of the CMS tracking system in a $rz$-view. Each tracker module is represented by one line~\cite{Chatrchyan:2008zzk}.}
  \label{fig:CMS_tracker}
\end{figure} 
\begin{description}
 \item \textbf{Pixel Detector:} The pixel detector consists of three barrel layers extending radially from 4.4\,cm to 10.2\,cm and two endcap disks on each side. In total, there are 1440 pixel modules installed. The size of one pixel cell is 100 x 150 \textmu m$^2$ providing similar track resolution quality in $r$--$\phi$ and $z$ direction. This configuration provides for almost the whole range up to $|\eta| = 2.5$ three precise hits which is especially important for the reconstruction of secondary vertices.
 \item \textbf{Silicon Strip Tracker:} The silicon strip detector which extends to a radius of 1.1\,m surrounds the pixel tracker. The more than 15\,000 individual strip detector modules are arranged in an inner and an outer detector part. The inner part of the strip tracker is build by the four \textit{Tracker Inner Barrel} (TIB) layers which are accompanied by the three \textit{Tracker Inner Disks} (TID) at the end sides. This inner part provides up to four track measurements in the $r$--$\phi$ plane. The TIB/TID system lies within the \textit{Tracker Outer Barrel} (TOB) consisting of another six barrel layers while it is complemented by the \textit{Tracker End Caps} (TEC) which add another nine disks at each side of the tracking system. This layout provides at least around nine hits within the silicon strip system. 
\end{description}
The tracking system with the design described above provides a precise impact parameter resolution and tracking efficiency~\cite{bib:cmstdr:tracker}. The impact parameter resolution is of the order of $<$ 35\,$\mu$m in the plane perpendicular to the beam (for particles with \pt$> 10$\gev) and reaches 75\,$\mu$m in the longitudinal direction. Furthermore, the track reconstruction efficiency of high energetic electrons is above 90\%, that of charged hadrons up to 95\% (for \pt$> 10$\gev) and that for muons even better than 98\% in the whole covered region up to $|\eta| = 2.5$. This is achieved already for muons with very low transverse momenta around 1\,GeV. Altogether, the relative transverse momentum resolution reaches a level of 1--2\% for high momentum tracks ($\approx$ 100\gev) in the barrel for $|\eta| < 1.6$.
 
\subsection{Electromagnetic Calorimeter}
\label{subsec:cms_ecal}
The CMS experiment makes use of a homogeneous electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), in order to precisely measure the energy deposits of electrons and photons. It is installed around the inner tracking system covering a range up to $|\eta| = 3.0$ and consists of lead tungstate (PbW$\mathrm{O}_4$) crystals. These have been chosen as they provide a high density, short radiation length and a small Moli\`{e}re radius and hence allow to build a compact calorimeter with a fine granularity. As 80\% of the scintillation light is emitted within 25\,ns, this allows ECAL operation at the bunch crossing rate of the LHC machine. In order to collect the radiated light, photodiodes are glued to the back of each crystal. A typical quantity to describe the extent of high-energy electromagnetic cascades is the radiation length $X_0$ that describes the characteristic amount of matter traversed by electrons and photons loosing energy by interacting with the material.\\
An overview of the ECAL layout is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CMS_ecal}. The individual sub-components are as follows:
\begin{figure}[!tp]

  \begin{tabular}{c}
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/Figures_Experimental_Apparatus_ECALRapidity.png}
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{View of one quarter section of the CMS electromagnetic calorimeter in a $yz$-view~\cite{bib:cmsptdr1}.}
  \label{fig:CMS_ecal}
\end{figure}
\begin{description}
 \item \textbf{Barrel ECAL (EB):} The barrel detector of the ECAL covers the pseudorapidity region up to $|\eta| = 1.479$. Within a radius of about 1.3\,m, a total number of 61\,200 crystals are installed. Each of them has a length of 230\,mm corresponding to a radiation length of 25.8~$\mathrm{X_0}$. The crystal cross section in $(\eta, \phi)$ is $(0.0174, 0.0174)$. Avalanche photodiodes are used to detect the emitted scintillation light.
 \item \textbf{Endcap ECAL (EE):} The EB is complemented on each side by an endcap which consists of two D-shaped halfs. The ECAL endcaps extend from $|\eta| = 1.479$ to $|\eta| = 3.0$. In total, they contain another 14\,648 crystals. They have an individual length of 220\,mm, which corresponds to 24.7~$\mathrm{X}_0$. For the collection of scintillation light, vacuum phototriodes are used in the endcaps.
 \item \textbf{Preshower (ES):} In front of the endcap crystals, a preshower detector is placed. It covers the pseudorapidity range of $|\eta| = 1.653$--$2.6$. The main purpose is to identify photons emerging from the decay of neutral pions. It is a two-layer sampling calorimeter with lead as absorber material and silicon strip sensors measuring the deposited energy. The total thickness of the preshower is 20\,cm (3~$\mathrm{X_0}$).
\end{description}
In order to achieve a stable and uniform energy measurement across the whole ECAL, an accurate calibration is of crucial importance. In addition to the calibration of the absolute energy scale especially channel-to-channel effects referred to as \textit{intercalibration} have to be accounted for. This is mainly done based on physics events. Changes in the transparency of the ECAL crystals during operation caused by irradiation are monitored by a dedicated laser system based on the injection of reference laser pulses into the crystals. The typical relative energy resolution for electrons with a transverse momentum of 120\gev with this calorimeter configuration is of the order of 0.5\%.

\subsection{Hadron Calorimeter}
\label{subsec:cms_hcal}
The calorimetry of the CMS experiment is completed by the hadron calorimeter (HCAL). It is designed to provide an accurate energy measurement of hadron jets and indirectly also of invisible particles, \eg neutrinos, by the determination of missing transverse energy. In order to measure the missing transverse energy, it is important that the calorimeter is hermetic, meaning that it provides a large geometric coverage to measure all particles emerging from an interaction. Thus, the HCAL is build such that a pseudorapidity range up to $|\eta| = 5.2$ is enclosed. \\ 
The hadron calorimeter completely surrounds the inner tracking system and the electromagnetic barrel calorimeter while it is mainly contained within the magnet system. Hence, its radial dimensions are limited on the one hand by the outer circumference of the barrel ECAL and on the other hand by the inner border of the magnet coil. An additional calorimeter component is installed outside the solenoid in the barrel part to ensure that the complete hadronic showers are contained in the HCAL. \\
An overview of the layout of the CMS hadron calorimeter is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CMS_hcal}. It is a typical sampling calorimeter with alternating layers of absorber material and active scintillator layers. The individual sub-components are:
\begin{figure}[!tp]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{c}
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/Figures_Experimental_Apparatus_HCAL.png}
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Longitudinal view of one quarter of the CMS detector showing the location of the individual HCAL sub-detector parts~\cite{Chatrchyan:2008zzk}.}
  \label{fig:CMS_hcal}
\end{figure}
\begin{description}
 \item \textbf{Hadron barrel (HB):} The barrel part of the CMS hadron calorimeter covers the pseudorapidity range up to $|\eta| = 1.3$ and is composed of two half barrels each containing 36 identical azimuthal wegdes. These wedges hold the absorber plates which are flat brass plates arranged parallel to the axis of the beam. For reasons of stability, the first and last layers are made of stainless steel. The total thickness of the absorber material ranges from 5.82 interaction lengths ($\lambda_I$) at $|\eta| = 0.0$ to 10.6\,$\lambda_I$ at $|\eta| = 1.3$. The 17 active plastic scintillator layers alternate with the absorber plates and have a segmentation in $(\Delta \eta, \Delta \phi)$ of (0.087, 0.087).\\
Each half barrel is divided into 16 $\eta$-regions for which the individual tiles are optically linked together using wavelength shifting fibres and thus form so-called \textit{HCAL towers}. The read-out of each longitudinal tower is carried out using pixelated hybrid photodiodes.
 \item \textbf{Hadron outer (HO):} The calorimeters in the central pseudorapidity region do not provide a sufficient depth in order to fully contain all hadronic showers. Therefore, the HB is complemented by the outer hadron barrel part which is placed outside the solenoid covering $|\eta| \le 1.26$. The HO makes use of the solenoid as additional absorber material and adds another one or even two layers in the most central part of scintillators to the barrel region. Thus, the total depth is extended to 11.8\,$\lambda_I$ at $\eta = 0$.
 \item \textbf{Hadron endcap (HE):} The hadron barrel calorimeter is supplemented by the hadron endcap. It is mounted on the endcap iron yoke and covers the pseudorapidity region of $1.3 \le |\eta| \le 3.0$ using 18 scintillator layers inserted into brass absorber plates. The granularity of the endcap calorimeter is the same as for the barrel up to $|\eta| = 1.6$ and gets coarser for larger pseudorapidities with $(\Delta \eta, \Delta \phi) \approx (0.17, 0.17)$.
 \item \textbf{Hadron forward (HF):} The forward hadron calorimeter extends the pseudorapidity coverage from $|\eta| = 2.9$ (slightly overlapping with the HE) up to $|\eta| = 5.2$. It is located 11.2\,m from the nominal interaction point and has to be radiation hard to cope with the vast particle flux. Thus, the HF is made of steel absorber plates with radiation hard quartz fibres integrated as active material. These fibres are arranged parallel to the beam line and form towers with a size in $(\Delta \eta, \Delta \phi)$ of $\approx$ (0.175, 0.175). The signal is detected as Cerenkov light originating from the quartz fibres.
\end{description}
Similar to the ECAL, also the performance of the HCAL has to be well monitored during operation. Thus, an initial calibration using a radioactive source is combined with test beam data to derive the absolute energy scale. A continous update of this calibrations is performed using isolated energetic particles, \eg from decays of W or Z bosons. 

\subsection{Muon System}
\label{subsec:cms_muon}
The outermost part of the CMS detector, as seen from the interaction point, is made up of the muon system. This component of the detector is assembled in the return yoke of the CMS magnet and consists of a central barrel cylinder complemented by endcap disks in the forward region. This results in a coverage of the pseudorapidity range up to $|\eta| = 2.4$. In the barrel part, four layers of detectors are installed alternating with the iron yoke while the detectors in the endcap are mounted on four discs perpendicular to the beam. In total, about 25\,000\,$\mathrm{m}^2$ detection planes are employed. The layout of the muon system is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:CMS_muon}. \\
To achieve a good muon momentum resolution and consider the different radiation conditions and variations in the homogenity of the magnetic field, three different types of gaseous detectors are used depending on the pseudorapidity. The different types of tracking chambers are:
\begin{figure}[!tp]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{c}
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/Figures_Experimental_Apparatus_MuonDetector.png}
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{View of one quarter section of the muon system in the $rz$-plane~\cite{bib:cmsptdr1}.}
  \label{fig:CMS_muon}
\end{figure}

\begin{description}
 \item \textbf{Drift tube (DT) chambers:} In the barrel region for $|\eta| < 1.2$, the background due to neutrons is low and residual effects from the magnetic field likewise. Here, the muon system is equipped with drift tube chambers. In the barrel, the muon coordinates in the $r\phi$-plane are measured in four stations while only the first three layers provide also a measurement of the $z$-direction. The drift length is restricted to a maximum of 21\,mm resulting in a negligible occupancy while keeping the number of channels at an acceptable level. Furthermore, a technology based on tubes is chosen avoiding the issue of possibly broken wires. The resolution in $r\phi$ is designed to reach a precision of 100\,\textmu m.
 \item \textbf{Cathode strip chambers (CSC):} The endcap regions are equipped with cathode strip and cover the pseudorapidity range $0.9 < |\eta| < 2.4$. These provide a fast response time and fine segmentation while they are resistant against radiation. Thus, they are well suited for the forward region where the muon and background rates are largely increased and the magnetic field is high and non-uniform. The CSCs, which are multiwire proportional chambers in which anode wires are interlaced with cathode panels, perform a precise position measurement in the $r\phi$--plane with a spatial resolution of 75--150\,\textmu m. 
 \item \textbf{Resistive plate chambers (RPC):} Resistive plate chambers are used to complement the drift tube and cathode strip chambers in the range $|\eta| < 1.6$. These are gaseous parallel-plate detectors with a spatial resolution coarser than the DTs and CSCs. However, they provide a very fast response and good time resolution at high particle rates. Thus, they are able to very efficiently detect the bunch-crossing a muon track is associated to. 
\end{description}
The global muon reconstruction efficiency is in general about 95--99\% and only drops for some $|\eta|$ regions, \eg in the transition region between the barrel and endcap part around $|\eta|=1.2$. Since muons reaching the muon system are affected by multiple scattering, the resolution for muons with transverse momenta below $\approx$ 200\,GeV is in general better based on the inner tracking system than for the muon system alone. For highly energetic muons it is comparable. In general, the muon momentum resolution can be improved by combining the information from the inner tracker and the muon system due to an improved fault finding. This combined approach results in a relative muon momentum resolution for muons with high momenta around 1\tev of about 5\%.

\subsection{Trigger System}
\label{subsec:cms_trigger}
The LHC operating at design conditions performs particle collisions with a bunch crossing rate of 40\,MHz. This results in an enormous amount of event data which have to be processed and stored for later analyses. With an approximate event size of 1\,MB, it is technically impossible to record all such events. However, as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:CrossSections}, the event rate of interesting potentially new physics events is orders of magnitudes smaller than the total inelastic proton-proton cross section. This allows to already perform in the trigger process a suitable event preselection in order to reduce the amount of data to a storable size while still retaining the information of interest. Hence, the trigger system makes up the first step in the physics analysis process.\\
In order to achieve the necessary rate reduction, the CMS experiment uses a two-stage trigger system:
\begin{description}
\item \textbf{Level-1 (L1) trigger:} The L1 trigger consists of custom-made fast programmable hardware. It makes use of data received from fast detector components which are the calorimeters and the muon system at reduced granularity. For that purpose, the calorimeter is divided into so-called \textit{trigger towers} which cover an area in $(\eta, \phi)$ of $(0.087, 0.087)$ up to $|\eta| = 1.74$ getting even coarser for higher $|\eta|$. At L1, the trigger decision is based on energy deposits in those trigger towers or certain hit patterns in the muon chambers forming trigger primitive objects which are electrons/photons, muons or jets and global quantities like sums of \et or \met. Events are accepted, if thosee trigger objects pass some predefined criteria like for instance certain \pt thresholds. The L1 trigger latency, \ie the time between the actual bunch crossing and the delivery of the L1 trigger decision to the front-end electronics, is 3.2\,\textmu s. During this period, the high resolution data is pipelined in readout buffers for further processing. The L1 trigger reduces the event rate to a maximum of 100\,kHz.
\item \textbf{High-Level trigger (HLT):} Events that are accepted by the L1 trigger stage are transferred to the High-Level trigger for further processing. The HLT is a software system running on several thousand commercial processors. It has access to the full information from all sub-detectors and performs an event reconstruction similar to the later event reconstruction performed for recorded data. Thus, it allows a further rate reduction to the final output rate of a few hundred Hz of events that are finally stored for analyses. Since the HLT is software based, it allows to continously adjust the used algorithms in order to adapt to changing conditions during operation.
\end{description}
In the two trigger stages, various different conditions can be tested in parallel which define the so-called \textit{trigger paths}. For instance, there exist dedicated trigger paths to select events with single electrons or muons above a certain \pt threshold or paths to collect events with a specific amount of missing transverse energy. All of these individual trigger paths form together the \textit{trigger menu} and are operated with a dedicated rate such that the total manageable output rate is not exceeded. Typically, the instantaneous luminosity changes gradually during operation which can result in changing output rates for individual trigger paths. In order to not exceed the allowed total trigger rate, the number of recorded events per trigger path can be adjusted accordingly by requiring that only each $n^\mathrm{th}$ triggered event is kept. The respective value of $n$ is denoted \textit{prescale factor}. 

\section{LHC Operation and Data Taking}
\label{sec:data}
\begin{figure}[!t]

  \caption{Cumulative integrated luminosity versus day delivered to CMS during stable beams for pp collisions. Different data-taking periods are indicated as follows: green for 2010, red for 2011 and blue for 2012~\cite{bib:lhc:lumi12}.}
  \label{fig:lhc_data}
\end{figure}
The first operation of the LHC took place in September 2008. After a major cooling incident only a few days later requiring a longer technical stop, beams were circulated again in November 2009. The first collisions at a center of mass energy of 7\tev finally happened end of March 2010~\cite{bib:lhcmachineoutreach}. In the following running period in 2010, data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 44.2\pbinv were delivered to the experiments with a maximum peak instantaneous luminosity of $2.05 \times 10^{32} \cm^{-2} \second^{-1}$. These data allowed studies of the detector performance and made first searches for new physics possible. The next data taking period performed during 2011 at the same centre of mass energy even lead to much more \pp collision data provided to the experiments. A total amount of 6.1\fbinv was delivered reaching a peak instantaneous luminosity of $3.5 \times 10^{33} \cm^{-2} \second^{-1}$. Following another technical shutdown during winter, the centre of mass energy was finally increased to 8\tev for the running period during 2012 and the peak luminosity reached values of up to $7.7 \times 10^{33} \cm^{-2} \second^{-1}$, which is already almost design conditions. In total, 23.3\fbinv of integrated luminosity \pp collisions were produced by the LHC operating at stable beam conditions. The evolution of the integrated luminosity versus days is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:lhc_data} for data-taking periods in 2010, 2011 and 2012. \\
During most of the operation in 2012, the LHC was circulating 1380 bunches per beam with a distance of 50\,ns. The average bunch intensity, \ie the number of protons per bunch, was varying from $1.6$ to $1.7 \times 10^{11}$ exceeding even the design value~\cite{bib:lhc:lumi12, Lamont:2013cma}. This was resulting in multiple interactions per bunch crossing known as \textit{pileup} (PU). In general, two sources of pileup are distinguished: \textit{in-time} pileup (IT PU) and \textit{out-of-time} pileup (OOT PU). While IT PU is caused by additional \pp collisions occuring within the same bunch-crossing as the primary hard collision and leads to additional tracks in the tracking system and energy deposits in the calorimeters, OOT PU arises from \pp collisions in previous and following bunch crossings and contributes further energy deposits in the calorimeters to the hard interaction due to the finite signal decay time in the calorimeters. An overview of the pileup profile in collision data taken in 2012 is given in Fig.~\ref{fig:lhc_pileup}. Here, the mean number of interactions per bunch crossing is illustrated with the mean of this distribution located at 21. The maximum number of mean pileup events even reached a value of $\approx 40$. Dedicated techniques in order to mitigate effects from pileup have been developed of which some are discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:Objects}.

\section{Event Simulation}
\label{sec:simulation}
An important tool in high energy physics is the use of simulation in order to acquire a good understanding of the behaviour of particle collisions and the collision products as they are observed in the detector. Thus, simulated events are often used as benchmarks in the development of new detector concepts. Moreover, they are heavily exploited in the validation and interpretation of the results of actual collision experiments, likewise for the LHC. For instance, simulated events are used to derive expectations for certain physics properties or the detector performance. In particular, they allow to estimate event kinematics of new physics events that can subsequently be used to derive \eg selection efficiencies. \\
This section provides a brief introduction to the principles of event simulation in hadron collisions and introduces some event generators including different approaches for the simulation of the detector. A broader overview of event simulation and respective generators for LHC physics can be found \eg in~\cite{Seymour:2013ega, Buckley:2011ms}. \\

The simulation of high energy collisions is a quite challenging task as each collision involves typically several hundred particles with momenta ranging over some orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the collisions being subject to quantum chromodynamics are only calculable within approximation schemes which furthermore often exhibit divergences. Thus, event simulation is primarily utilizing numerical \textit{Monte Carlo} (MC) techniques which rely on the repeated sampling of random numbers, \cf for instance~\cite{bib:MCMethod}. For convenience, events obtained from simulation are denoted by the label 'MC' in this thesis. \\
Typically, the generation of an event follows several subsequent steps which are illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:mc_gen} and described in the following:

\begin{description} 
 \item \textbf{Hard process:} The first step in the simulation of collision events is the description of the nominal parton-parton interaction which is typically referred to as \textit{hard process}. The proton itself is not a fundamental particle but exhibits an internal structure. The constituents of which a proton is made off are known as \textit{partons}. Thus, two protons interact when there is a momentum transfer \textit{Q} taking place between two individual partons. The probability for individual partons to take part in the hard interaction is parametrized by the \textit{parton-distribution functions} (PDFs) which have been determined experimentally for instance in deep-inelasting scattering at the HERA collider~\cite{bib:CombinedHERA:2009wt}. The value of $x$ denotes the fraction of the longitudinal momentum carried by an individual parton. Consequently, the initial state of a parton-parton collision is unknown. Nevertheless, the cross section of a specific process can be calculated following the \textit{factorization theorem}~\cite{Collins:1987pm, Collins:1989gx}. Here, the hard interaction is described via perturbation theory and low-energy processes are considered in the phenomenological and theoretical models of the respective PDFs. Thus, the cross section for a process $ab \rightarrow n$ is given according to
\begin{equation}
 \sigma = \sum_{a,b} \int_{0}^{1} dx_{a} \, dx_{b} \int f_{a}(x_{a}, \mu_{F}) f_{b}(x_{b}, \mu_{F}) \, d\hat{\sigma}_{ab \rightarrow n} (\mu_{F}, \mu_{R}). 
\end{equation}
Here, $f(x, \mu_{F})$ are the PDFs of the interacting protons which depend on the factorization scale $\mu_{F}$ while $\sigma_{ab \rightarrow n}$ indicates the parton-level cross section for the production of a final state $n$ from partons $a$ and $b$. This parton-level cross section depends on the final-state phase space, the factorization scale and the renormalisation scale $\mu_{R}$ as well as the corresponding matrix element. The factorization and renormalization scales are unphysical and have to be chosen for the generation process. Usually, the process possesses a typical hard scale $Q^{2}$ so that the choice $\mu_{F} = \mu_{R} = Q^{2}$ is made. However, this choice is not fixed by first principles and has to be considered as uncertainty in the calculation.
\item \textbf{Parton shower:} After the production in the hard interaction, the outgoing partons start to form a \textit{shower}, \ie cascades of further parton emissions. Typically, this happens with descending amounts of momentum transfer from the high scales down to low scales around 1\gev. This evolution is typically described by a probabilistic shower algorithm. In addition to a parton shower related to the outgoing partons which is referred to as \textit{final-state radiation} (FSR), also the initial-state partons can radiate off other partons before the actual hard process takes place. This effect is known as \textit{initial-state radiation} and can be described by similar principles as FSR. 
 \item \textbf{Hadronization:} The evolution of the parton shower continues until low scales in momentum transfer are reached and so the final state partons eventually start to form colour neutral hadrons. In the context of simulation the term \textit{hadronization} describes the particular model which is used in order to specify the transition from the partonic state to the complete hadronic final state. Since the hadronization involves low-energetic processes, it can not be treated within perturbation theory. One distinguishes between \textit{string models} (\cf for instance~\cite{Andersson198331}) and \textit{cluster models} (\cf for instance~\cite{Amati197987, Bassetto1979207}) in order to characterize the hadronization. While the first model describes directly the transition from the parton to the hadron based on the assumption of linear confinement, \ie a linearly rising potential, the second model introduces an intermediate step of cluster objects with mass scales around a few~\gev. Particles arising from the hadronization are denoted with \textit{generator-level} particles and labelled 'gen' within this thesis.
 \item \textbf{Decay:} After the hadronization process, a couple of unstable hadrons are present in the event whose decay into stable particles must be modelled. Stable in this context means that they do not decay further within the typical collider timescales ($c\tau > 10$\mm). Thus, the observable final-state hadrons result from a convolution of the hadronization process with the decay modelling. Concerning the decay process a choice has to be made regarding the hadrons to be included in the simulation and the respective decay modes which have to be considered. Mainly, theses choices are based on experimental results in combination with theoretical assumptions. Typical differences occur for instance in the consideration of excited mesons or heavy baryon multiplets as well as the treatment of matrix elements and spin correlations during the decay. 
 \item \textbf{Underlying event:} In addition to hadrons emerging from the process connected directly to the hard interaction, further contributions to the event can be present which is referred to as \textit{underlying event} (UE). The UE activity can be for instance caused by additional interactions occuring for incoming partons, which is known as \textit{multiple parton interaction} (MPI), or by interactions arising from the proton remnants. In general, such effects contribute to the total amount of scattered energy and increase the number of particles appearing in the hadronization process. 
\end{description}
The various sub-processes described above are the basis of various event generators which differ in some aspects concerning the treatment of individual sub-processes in the event simulation. In this thesis, different generators are used:
\begin{description}
 \item \textbf{PYTHIA}~\cite{Sjostrand:2006za}: \pythia is a general purpose event generator which has been used already extensively at previous collider experiments. It is designed to simulate collisions of either hadrons or same-generation leptons. This means that it is well suited to model \pp collisions. The highest multiplicity of particles involved in the hard interaction that can be simulated with \pythia are $2 \rightarrow 3$ processes. Nonetheless, more than three final state particles can arise for instance from the parton shower. This is traditionally $Q^2$ ordered. The hadronization model in \pythia is based on the aforementioned string model. Besides the simulation of whole physics events including all relevant steps, \pythia can also be interfaced to other generator programs in order to carry out the parton shower, hadronization and decay steps only.
 \item \textbf{HERWIG++}~\cite{Bahr:2008pv}: Like \pythia, \herwig is a general purpose MC generator. It provides the possibility to simulate high-energy collisions for lepton-lepton, lepton-hadron and hadron-hadron processes with special emphasis on the modelling of QCD radiation. Thus, the distinct feature of \herwig is that colour coherence effects are taken into account by employing angular ordered parton showers meaning that the coherence of soft radiation is treated correctly. The hadronization process is based on the cluster model. 
 \item \textbf{MADGRAPH}~\cite{Alwall:2007st, Alwall:2014hca}: \madgraph is a general-purpose matrix-element program and designed to provide accurate descriptions of multiparton processes. It is the only generator that is capable of computing any arbitrary process at tree level or at NLO. In principle, it is possible to generate any $2 \rightarrow n$ process. However, in order to achieve reasonable computing times, the number of partons is typically limited to values $< 10$. \madgraph can commonly be interfaced to \pythia for the realisation of the showering, hadronization and decay.
 \item \textbf{POWHEG}~\cite{Oleari:2010nx}: The \textsc{powheg} programme provides accurate QCD computations based on matrix elements up to next-to-leading order following the concept proposed in~\cite{Nason:2004rx}. It can be interfaced to shower programs like \pythia or \herwig in order to perform the subsequent showering process.   
\end{description}
In order to evaluate the interaction of the generated particles with the detector material, the passage of the particles through the detector is simulated. This is done based on a detailled model of the CMS apparatus utilizing the GEANT4 programme~\cite{Agostinelli2003250} and referred to as \textit{full simulation}. Full simulation is quite extensive in computing time and thus for several purposes also a simplified scheme of the detector model is used which is known as \textit{fast simulation}~\cite{Abdullin:2011zz}. Especially in analyses in which many signal samples are needed to scan a wide parameter range, \eg in SUSY analyses, the usage of the fast simulation is very beneficial. A comparison of several relevant kinematic distributions in real collision events to simulated events obtained from fast simulation shows a quite good agreement~\cite{CMS-DP-2010-039}. In particular, also jet related quantities like the sum of calorimetric jet momenta or the missing transverse momentum are modelled with a similar accuracy in full and fast simulation. \\  
Finally, recorded collision data as well as simulated events including the modelling of the passage through the detector are present in the same data format which allows to apply the same reconstruction algorithms in order to derive physics objects from the low-level event data. These algorithms are discussed int the next chapter.
